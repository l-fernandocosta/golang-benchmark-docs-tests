The content of this repository was based on the last chapter of the book "Go in Action" by author William Kennedy.

This repository is for study purposes only.

The idea was to study the tools provided by Go for:

- Testing;
- Benchmarking;
- Documentation;

If you wish to reproduce, use the `Makefile` in the root directory.
- Run tests:
-- `make test`
- Run documentation:
-- `make doc` (It will make the documentation available on port :3000 by default)
- Run benchmark:
-- `make bench`
